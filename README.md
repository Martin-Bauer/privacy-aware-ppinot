# privacy-aware-ppinot
This repository contains the Java-based source code and the evaluation files for the definition and evaluation of privacy-aware process performance indicators.
This package builds upon the definition- and evaluation-approaches, as defined by the "Process Performance Indicator Notation" (PPINOT), which are publicly available via Maven.

## Installation
Clone the repository and resolve the depencies defined in the pom.xml.
After all dependencies have been resolved you are good to go.

## Useage
In general, the definition and evaluation process for PPIs remains the same as in the original PPINOT packages, so please have a look at those first.
Firthmore, please have a look at the implementations provided in the file "CalcPPI.java", that contains the definition and evaluation procedures for multiple privacy-aware PPIs on the basis of the publicly available "Sepsis Cases"-Log file.

## Evaluation Results
The result files, figures and scripts used for the creation of those figures, which were used used for the evaluation in the paper, are located in the directory "Evaluation".
